#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` constants to match the new “Task Decomposition Engine” description.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create this file to generate the app logo (the image will be produced from the `.todo` instructions).

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for it. I will also create the `logo.png.todo` file for you.
